- Users log in via Google to grant access to their Ads accounts
- OAuth consent screen displays: `SmartAds Auth Gateway`

2. System retrieves accessible Google Ads accounts
3. User selects an account â†’ `customer_id` is stored
4. From there, the system allows:
   - Managing campaigns (CampaignService)
   - Updating budgets (CampaignBudgetService)
   - Sending access invitations (CustomerUserAccessInvitationService)
   - Fetching reports (GoogleAdsService)
